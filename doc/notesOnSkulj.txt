(* The def of F-field (Skulj sect 3.1, p. 1316) says that it's an
 * F-field iff for each set A in the algebra, there's a prob dist p in
 * the credal set s.t. L(A) = inf p(A).  Mutatis mutandis for U(A).
 * i.e. when we sum atomic probs to get L(A), they must be probs from
 * the same dist p.  This is so even though l(a) and u(a) for atoms
 * might use different prob dists for different atoms a.
 *
 * This means that the empty set will have min and max probs 0, and
 * Omega will have min and max probs 1.
 *
 * This is what min_alg_probs and max_alg_probs compute.
 *
 * Note also that since U(A) = 1 - L(-A) and L(A) = 1 - U(-A), for an
 * given set A, L(A) and U(A) are sums wrt the same dist p.
 *)

(* In section 3.3 of Skulj, p. 1317, the def of L(A) seems to use sums
 * of *different* prob dists, as I read the last line of the preceding
 * paragraph.  i.e. Sum l(omega) for omega in A is such that l(omega)
 * may use different probs p for different omegas.  And likewise for
 * Sum u(omega).
 *
 * This means that there is no reason to think that either Sum
 * l(omega) or Sum u(omega) are probabilities in any distribution p.
 * Therefore neither is 1 - the latter sum.  Since neither of these
 * values are probabilities per se, neither is their max.
 * Therefore L(A) needn't be a prob in any distribution p.  And
 * therefore L(A) needn't be a probability in any p.
 *
 * A similar point holds for U(A).
 *
 * This means, also, that L(empty) or U(empty) needn't be equal to 
 * zero, nor must L(Omega) and U(Omega) be equal to 1.
 * Ah, *this is wrong*:
 * Mins and maxes for the empty set will always be zero.
 * So when A = Omega, 1-Sum u(omega) when there are no such omegas
 * will always be >= sum of the l(omega)'s.
 * Similarly, when A = Omega, 1-Sum L(omega) for omega in empty will
 * again be equal to 1 - 0.  But Sum u(omega) for omega in Omega must
 * be >= 1, since for any particular p, the sum of the atom probs is 1.
 * So again we have that U(Omega) = 1.
 *
 * But: pri_f_field_{lowers,uppers} implement L(A) and U(A) in this
 * sense--or at least they're supposed to, and they seem to.  Note
 * though it appears, experimentally, that L(A) = 1 - U(-A) for all A,
 * and likewise U(A) = 1 - L(-A).  Which is not what I expected,
 * intuitively, although it fits with Skulj's apparent claim that
 * these implement an F-field.  Which my reasoning above
 * contradicts.... it seems.  Something I'm missing.
