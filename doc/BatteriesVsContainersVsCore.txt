Notes on Batteries vs. Containers vs. Core for this project

Batteries has a LazyList
Containers has one in Containers.Iter (containers_iter.cm*").
Not sure about Core.

All three have List.range, but each does it differently.

Containers has List.fold_while.  Cool.
In general its List looks very nice.

I used Core.Float for an integer/float power function.  This is my only
use of Core apart from commandline processing.  Batteries and Containers
have pow functions in Int and Float.  I don't think I have to use the
Core kind of function.
