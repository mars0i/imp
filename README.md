[Imprecise
probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecise_probability) and
[population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics)
in [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/) using
[Owl](https://github.com/ryanrhymes/owl) and other libraries.
Experimental work in progress that I am keeping around because of the
experiments in it.  A cleaned up and improved version of the best parts
of this repo are in the
[mars0i/imprecise-evolution](https://github.com/mars0i/imprecise-evolution)
repo.  There is more information there.

Some of this was written when I was learning OCaml.  (I am still learning
OCaml.)
